Throw a Watermelon
by Hoani

For GMC Jam 52's theme, I wanted to try gamemaker's physics simulator.

Controls:

Mouse Left - place items
Mouse Right - delete items
Mouse Center - scroll different items

Press play to start
Hover over help/items for additional info

Credits:

I made everything in this game

I was actually inspired to try this after seeing people compose thier own music/sound in the last jam... so this is the first time I've made some music

Tools: Gamemaker, beatbox.co, krita and excalidraw

Enjoy!
